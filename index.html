<title>Rodney King Jr. Beatings (Suicide), Propagated</title>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">I don't think you should empower people, nor should you excuse that you almost killed MLK Jr., by writing a letter, from the President then, to kill the subjugated historically, the people who care like him, and who actually effect changes! Hoover didn't work alone to try to kill all the truly Powerful, Spiritual, who isn't a question, that takes time to answer, but just abusive narcissism, enabled every step along the way, until it became popularized by someone who cares about God, like some others, who will pray to defeat the Devils, not the Godly . My name isn't important to you, yet, but it will be heard, with my message - God wins. Mina's the guy, what'sup, Newsom? I am not my hair either, brother Gavin, and I know that yours isn't unruly. I know, differently, that my real friend and kind-hearted brother West, is one you should befriend, but cannot, inexplicably, or perhaps for reasons. Thanks for your vote for President, guys, in a real place, not a strange creative place that doesn't exist, with your violent, petulant temperaments, right vigorous Joe? Let's not be peaceful, not speak up, I wanna be Spiritual</h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #ff00ff;">Hi! I live here now, I guess, on a webpage, so you can be better people and mooch and rob and torture and pillage me, sometimes literally you think, stupidly negate American history, in favor of racism, even though you appear to care, you're a person without any kind tendencies, who would surely abuse for fun, as you've done historically!</span></strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000;">Please visit my webpage today! They change, like American history. Every one is unique and individually important, not sponsored by anyone, any person, but my own discounted experiences. As Kanye West proclaimed on New Slaves, I am not for sale, I am not not going to fight the Neo-Nazis, I am going to be stronger than them.</span></strong></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Work is by Mina, all of it is my own, intellectual property theft is a felony punishable by hard time, which I wouldn't fuck with, even if I tried, unlike most people who are popular these days, politicians, and musicians, and painters, and photographers. Copy correctly, do not steal, nor take without permission, because that is so hurtful to the people I represent, not you, historically.</h3>

It is for blind creativity? No, it's for a purpose of medical information that is improperly dispensed, as radicals don't do bullshit.)</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">These are not replicative, and most have you scratching your head: why didn't my son or daughter, genius parent, step-dad (Barack, you good? How's LoLo, and would you be an honorary fighter of racial injustice, but not represent those who take credit for my shit, and basically wearing the oppressor's mask instead), or friend, or anyone think of that, and it shouldn't make you angry, but stronger, but not because I work for you, not because I'm manic and arrogant, it's because I talk real shit about who I am, it isn't your story, but it's mine, kittens. If they're overwhelming for you, there's something wrong with your sensory system, not mine, and I'm good, really good, not bad, so yeah. I don't fuck around, and I won't succumb to injustice, and I choose love over justice anyday, because that system is corrupt, and intentionally erases important heroes like me, everyday, who are completely unlike you, a lazy, similar oppressor, who turns his back and stabs his sister instead. You are not to harm others for personal benefit, to assume genius and talent and lovingkindess, because you do not do anything but mock while you strike, and later disobey what's right, criticizing yourselves falsely, while putting things under rugs.</span></h3>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">List to be added to, with its corresponding hardness (I don't do interviews, like you do and will, because you'll be interrogated the same heinous way.)</h3>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Bye, but not forever, and don't scare me into foreverly apathy. I don't abuse others, nor drugs and alcohol, like most famous people and their politicans, and I do not fuck with any politics, because it's not loving, in its current state of oppression and narcissism.</h3>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">I represent myself, and God is my agent, take a good look at yourselves in the mirror and break them because you're just way ugly, unartistic, disgraceful, and most of you are already disgraced, because you've tried to falsely repudiate, but I won't. Money-back guarantee.</h3>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">"Atheism" is a nickname for Satanism; shiny writing makes it appear logical, but those philosophers are in Hell, for not just denying, but lying. "Agnosticism" is worse, like a forever-dangling-carrot, it's a way to abusive Spiritual sorts. To clarify, I'm not a jailbird, lol but I'm a hero, someone doing this to express that He's the truth, and I'll stay spitting the truth always, right at you racists' falsely pure Satanists.</h3>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Holiday Season, happy Hannukah, Kwanza, Christmas, Father, Pure Spirituality only, no fakes, no Satanists in disguise, who don't appreciate the forgiveness and nonviolence that oppression teaches, and that fighting against Satan always needs patience. I don't call anyone to action, that's stupid, a bad idea, something that shouldn't happen, because that's not how creativity works, with hugs and stares, rages, and pointless despair, and God needs you to be human and emotional, using it not abusing others who use theirs. (Can you abuse others legally, psychologically, with verbal threats, and monetary ones in 2023, <a href="mailto:minasargious@gmail.com">Mina</a></h3>
